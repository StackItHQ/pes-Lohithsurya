# Superjoin Hiring Assignment

### Welcome to Superjoin's hiring assignment! üöÄ

### Objective
Build a solution that enables real-time synchronization of data between a Google Sheet and a specified database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL). The solution should detect changes in the Google Sheet and update the database accordingly, and vice versa.

### Problem Statement
Many businesses use Google Sheets for collaborative data management and databases for more robust and scalable data storage. However, keeping the data synchronised between Google Sheets and databases is often a manual and error-prone process. Your task is to develop a solution that automates this synchronisation, ensuring that changes in one are reflected in the other in real-time.

### Requirements:
1. Real-time Synchronisation
  - Implement a system that detects changes in Google Sheets and updates the database accordingly.
   - Similarly, detect changes in the database and update the Google Sheet.
  2.	CRUD Operations
   - Ensure the system supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for both Google Sheets and the database.
   - Maintain data consistency across both platforms.
   
### Optional Challenges (This is not mandatory):
1. Conflict Handling
- Develop a strategy to handle conflicts that may arise when changes are made simultaneously in both Google Sheets and the database.
- Provide options for conflict resolution (e.g., last write wins, user-defined rules).
    
2. Scalability: 	
- Ensure the solution can handle large datasets and high-frequency updates without performance degradation.
- Optimize for scalability and efficiency.

## Submission ‚è∞
The timeline for this submission is: **Next 2 days**

Some things you might want to take care of:
- Make use of git and commit your steps!
- Use good coding practices.
- Write beautiful and readable code. Well-written code is nothing less than a work of art.
- Use semantic variable naming.
- Your code should be organized well in files and folders which is easy to figure out.
- If there is something happening in your code that is not very intuitive, add some comments.
- Add to this README at the bottom explaining your approach (brownie points üòã)
- Use ChatGPT4o/o1/Github Co-pilot, anything that accelerates how you work üí™üèΩ. 

Make sure you finish the assignment a little earlier than this so you have time to make any final changes.

Once you're done, make sure you **record a video** showing your project working. The video should **NOT** be longer than 120 seconds. While you record the video, tell us about your biggest blocker, and how you overcame it! Don't be shy, talk us through, we'd love that.

We have a checklist at the bottom of this README file, which you should update as your progress with your assignment. It will help us evaluate your project.

- [‚úÖ ] My code's working just fine! ü•≥
- [ ‚úÖ] I have recorded a video showing it working and embedded it in the README ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
- [‚úÖ ] I have tested all the normal working cases üòé
- [ ] I have even solved some edge cases (brownie points) üí™
- [ ‚úÖ] I added my very planned-out approach to the problem at the end of this README üìú

## Got Questions‚ùì
Feel free to check the discussions tab, you might get some help there. Check out that tab before reaching out to us. Also, did you know, the internet is a great place to explore? üòõ

We're available at techhiring@superjoin.ai for all queries. 

All the best ‚ú®.

## Developer's Section
*Add your video here, and your approach to the problem (optional). Leave some comments for us here if you want, we will be reading this :)*

Approach:

First things first i knew how to connect to the database (which i'm using MySQL) and second thing to do to find a way write and read from google sheets which from a previous knowledge knowing google provides many api's i started to search if there was google sheets api and which i used to write the data from db to sheets and used a ngrok for real-time synchronization which i came across chat-gpt and used appscript to triggers to snchronize sheets data to db and after ever check of sheets for update it goes and synchronizes db to sheets.


In his you can choose which database you want tables to be on sheets and for every database you a separate spreadsheet and each table as separate sheet within the spreadsheet, if the spreadsheet doesn't exist it will create a new spreadsheet as it is new database which we are trying to get to sheets.


The main problem which i faced was making it properly send and get the post request from the triggers and to make my url available to internet as i was running on localhost, but later through stackeroverflow and chatgpt i figured a way to get a my localhost to internet.


For a clear flow and what all technologies i have used you can go and check my read file above
